	光明会（Illuminati）是否与更波斯沃教有关呢？祆教，又名琐罗亚斯德教（Zoroastrianism）是流行于波斯（Persia）及中亚等地的宗教，中国史称祆教、火祆教、拜火教，《依天屠龙记》里叫明教。<a href= "pic14.html">印度西海岸古吉拉特邦孟买</a>聚居的帕西人（Parsi）也信奉祆教。在8-10世纪，Parsi不愿改信伊斯兰教，从波斯（现在的伊朗）移民而来。Parsi人与犹太人一样善于经商，是印度受教育程度最高、最为富有的社群。<br><br>

	A 2001 adventure film adapted from the Tomb Raider video game series; Lara Croft races against time and villains to recover a powerful artefact called the Triangle of Light.<br><br>
	In the film Lara Croft is portrayed as a treasure hunter. She has to get the parts of the triangle of light artefact before the Illuminati get it. Lara’s father (an archaeologist) was trying to find the parts before he died, and has passed on his work to Lara. <br><br>
	She goes to Angkor Wat and to a place in Siberia to find the pieces of the triangle of light. Angkor Wat is a real archaeological site in Cambodia. Part of Angkor Wat has been shown to hold one half of the triangle of light in a hidden temple room. Really this site is a temple complex that comes from the Angkorian period (9th to 15th century). The site is about 400 square km in size and located in the northwestern part of Cambodia. <br><br>

	Both Lara and the Illuminati want the triangle of light to be able to have the power that it holds. In the end Lara saves the day and destroys the triangle of light.<br><br>

	Illuminati<br><br>

	The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") is a name given to several groups, both real (historical) and fictitious. Historically the name refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. In more modern contexts the name refers to a purported conspiratorial organization which is alleged to mastermind events and control world affairs through governments and corporations to establish a New World Order. <br><br>
