	<br>雅利安（Aryan是梵文，意为“高贵”），公元前1500年左右迁入南亚次大陆（当时已经有人类居住）。土著跟客家难免冲突，成王败寇，“高贵”是战胜者书写历史时对自己的称呼。与之类似的有“日耳曼（German）人大迁徙”，不过这一次入侵罗马帝国的行动却被成为“野蛮人入侵”。现今的日耳曼人已经是有钱有势一族了。<br><br>
	雅利安南迁少有史可考（我们也无暇顾及），而日耳曼人的大迁徙和崛起则有据可查。两相比较，我们是能悟出一些道理的。类似的还有蒙古成吉思汗（Genghis Khan）、忽必烈（Kublai）和他们的子孙，<a href="pic12.html">帝国疆土</a>就包括了南亚。<br><br>
	
	The Migration Period, also known as the period of the Barbarian Invasions or of the Volkerwanderung ("migration of peoples"), was a period of intensified human migration in Europe from about 400 to 800 AD. Historians consider it to be the transition from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages. This period was marked by profound changes both within the Roman Empire and beyond its "barbarian frontier". The migrants who came first were Germanic tribes such as the Goths, Vandals, Angles, Saxons, Lombards, Suebi, Frisii and Franks; they were later pushed westwards by the Huns, Avars, Slavs, Bulgars and Alans. Later migrations (such as the Arab conquest and Viking, Normans, Magyar, Moorish, Turkic, and Mongol invasions) also had significant effects (especially in North Africa, the Iberian peninsula, Anatolia and Central and Eastern Europe); however, they are outside the scope of the Migration Period.<br><br>

	印度也有移民迁出到欧洲的，比如吉普赛人、波希米亚人和弗拉门戈人。<br><br>
